  <h1>Basics – The Foundation</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">Understanding what truth is before we look at historical events chronologically.</p>
</header>

<div class="container">

  <h2 class="goal">Common definitions of truth</h2>
  <p>
    “True is that which corresponds to reality,” “A correspondence with a fact,” and similar definitions sound 
    correct, but they also lead us down the wrong path.
  </p>

  <h2 class="motivation">Why are these definitions useless?</h2>
  <p>
    Instead of providing concrete criteria for true statements, they leave open the possibility of having many “truths” in parallel
    . To the best of our knowledge and belief, this can never be right. “It's true for you, but not for me” obscures
    the truth and is fundamentally untrue. Previous definitions do not even make it clear that absolute truth 
    exists or can exist! This makes the definition contradictory from the outset—a “false definition of truth.” 
    We need something with which we can search for truth! Interestingly, this apparently only works with a “person.”
    In keeping with the worldview that is ultimately most clearly true.
  </p>

  <h2 class="definition">Definition of truth</h2>
  <p>
    Truth is that which is confirmed by at least one person who 
    <br>1. is 100% honest, 
    <br>2. has 100% of the relevant information about the matter, and 
    <br>3. understands it 100%. 
  </p>

  <h2 class="logik">Obvious conclusions</h2>
  <p>
    Whether or not absolute truth exists is indisputable; everyone knows deep down that it does. Otherwise, things could
    simply vanish into thin air and there would be no more constancy in the universe. The mistake made by person X remains the mistake made by person X,
    forever! It is impossible that someone else will suddenly feel guilty and take responsibility for the mistake at some point.
    Every event always happens in only one way. The tree does not fall 2° northwest and at the same time or afterwards 5° northeast. In other words, truth
    remains the same for all eternity! It follows that once information has changed, its truthfulness is already very
    doubtful! If information is constantly being revised within a worldview, so much the worse! (Interpretation is not the same as information).   
  </p>

  <h2 class="timeline">Further conclusions</h2>
  <p>
    • This honest and objective definition reveals that we as humans have a major problem recognizing truth at all.
    A child can recognize simple things, but when it comes to distant history or nature, the hurdles are immediately enormous.
    Understanding this requires humility. Those who cannot accept that we have very little chance of achieving 100% certain knowledge will never reach their goal and remain
    trapped in their proud delusion.
    
    <br>• Interestingly, it is also quickly apparent that truth is only a concept of the human mind. Matter and animals do not have
    the ability to seek truth. (There is no proof of this.)
    
    <br>• So we need information that has always remained constant, just like 1+1=2. That comes closest to the truth.

    <br>• What is most striking in historical research? There is one book that shines brightest with the criteria of truth: the Bible!
    A book written by about 40 authors over several millennia, yet with a common thread, unchanged and without verifiable contradictions.
    More evidence of its history is being progressively unearthed. So we must take the book seriously and examine and compare the history!
</p>

  <h2 class="advantages">What are the benefits?</h2>
  <p>
    Those who understand this most fundamental basis can:
    <br>• recognize false assumptions more quickly
    <br>• better understand historical contexts
    <br>• discover a worldview that is rational and spiritually sound, and thus has the only chance of absolute truth!
    <br>
    <br><strong>Conclusion: After more than 150 generations of written history, it seems extremely implausible that we, of all people, would be the “first” to find the truth today.</strong> If we 
    reject the clear written information from the past, we are on a megalomaniacal trip.
